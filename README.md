# tic-tac-toe
This is an implementation of a tic-tac-toe game using Reinforcement Learning.

I have implemented Monte Carlo and Q-learning.

How to run: `python3 play.py [argv[1]]`. In place of `argv[1]` write `train` to let two agents (one of MC and one of QL) play against each other and train themselves in the process, or write anything other than `train` to play with the MC agent.
